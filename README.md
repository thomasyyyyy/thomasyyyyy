### Hi there, I’m Thomas Young 👋 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring academic and researcher with a background in Business Analytics and a growing portfolio of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of consumer behavior, AI, and linguistic analysis. Currently, I’m working on projects that explore brand voice consistency, trust in AI, and interpersonal dynamics in human-computer interaction.

### 🧠 About Me
While earning my Bachelor's in Business Analytics, I developed core research skills in academic writing, data analysis, and text mining using R, Python, and SQL.

In summer 2024, I completed a MITACS internship with Dr. Holly Howe, where I reviewed literature on brand voice consistency, scraped 250,000+ social media posts, and analyzed over 20 linguistic features using LIWC and nltk. I also gained experience in image analytics (OpenCV), regression, and network modeling (R's statnet).

I presented this work at SCP 2025 and am co-authoring a manuscript for journals like JCR. Attending ACR 2024 further fueled my interest in authenticity, trust, and AI as social agents.

As a Research Associate at the University of Exeter’s AI in Group Work lab, I led projects on collaborative intelligence—designing surveys in Qualtrics, submitting ethics applications, and advising university policy through research grounded in HR, decision science, and computer science.

🧵 Image Consistency
Analyzed hundreds of thousands of social media posts across platforms to assess how consistent brand messaging impacts consumer perception. Employed Python and R to extract, preprocess, and analyze text across various linguistic dimensions. (Data unavailable due to ownership).

📊 Airbnb Dashboard
Analyses over 2000 Airbnb listings in Bristol, UK to offer strategic recommendations to increase host growth and increase occupancy rate.

🍞 Young's Bakery HR – Simulated SQL Database
To sharpen my SQL skills and demonstrate relational database design principles, I created a fictional HR database for "Young's Bakery". This mock database models realistic HR and operations data for a local bakery, making it an ideal sandbox for practicing advanced SQL queries, joins, and database normalization.
