### Hi there, I’m Thomas Young 👋 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring academic and researcher with a background in Business Analytics and a growing portfolio of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of consumer behavior, AI, and linguistic analysis. Currently, I’m working on projects that explore brand voice consistency, trust in AI, and interpersonal dynamics in human-computer interaction.

### 🧠 About Me
While studying for my Bachelor's in Business Analytics, I’ve developed strong core research skills ranging from academic writing and time management to data manipulation and textual analysis using R, Python, and SQL.

In the summer of 2024, I completed a MITACS research internship under the guidance of Dr. Holly Howe. I conducted an extensive literature review on brand voice consistency, scraped over 250,000 social media posts, and analyzed more than 20 linguistic features using tools like LIWC and Python’s nltk. I also developed competencies in image analytics (OpenCV), regression analysis, and network modeling (R's statnet).

I presented this work at SCP 2025 in Las Vegas and am currently co-authoring a manuscript we plan to submit to journals such as JCR. Attending ACR 2024 deepened my appreciation for rigorous consumer research and sharpened my interest in authenticity, trust, and AI as social agents.

As a Research Associate at the University of Exeter’s AI in Group Work lab, I explored collaborative intelligence and team dynamics in the context of AI-human collaboration. I led projects spanning Qualtrics survey design, ethical review submissions, and university policy consultations, drawing from research in HR, decision science, and computer science.

🌟 Highlighted Projects

🧵 Brand Voice Consistency, Linguistic Analysis, and Image Analysis
Analyzed hundreds of thousands of social media posts across platforms to assess how consistent brand messaging impacts consumer perception. Employed Python and R to extract, preprocess, and analyze text across various linguistic dimensions.

📊 Airbnb Dashboard
Analyses over 2000 Airbnb listings in Bristol, UK to offer strategic recommendations to increase host growth and increase occupancy rate.

🍞 Young's Bakery HR – Simulated SQL Database
To sharpen my SQL skills and demonstrate relational database design principles, I created a fictional HR database for "Young's Bakery". This mock database models realistic HR and operations data for a local bakery, making it an ideal sandbox for practicing advanced SQL queries, joins, and database normalization.
